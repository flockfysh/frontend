# File & Folder Naming

-   All file names and folders should be in camelCase

# Code Structure

-   New pages should have their own folder under `src/pages/` <br>
    e.x: I am creating a homepage. The `.tsx` file would then be located here: `src/pages/home/home.tsx`.
-   Components should go under components folder.

# Quotes

-   Use single quotes for all quotes (**JSX classNames, paths, etc, should be in double quotes**)
-   If a single quote is neccessary in a string. <br>
    Context:
    `console.log('Can't do this');`

    Prefer template literals:
    <br>
    `` console.log(`Can't do this`); ``
    <br>
    Over double qoutes:
    <br>
    `console.log("Don't do this");`

# Use semicolons.

# Packages

-   Consult Frontend team before adding new packages.
    -   This will help keep reduce unneccessary overhead for the repo.
-   When installing a new package, check if there is a types package for it as well.

# Functions

-   Prefer named functions for anonymous callbacks
    <br>
    Prefer:
    <br>

```
setTimeout(
    function logUserEntry() {
        console.log('...')
    }
, 1000);
```

    <br>
    Over:
    <br>

```
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('...');
}, 1000);
```

    This will help readers of the code faster and better understand what the function is doing.

    ### This does not apply when you need lexical `this` behaviour. In this case, use arrow functions.

-   Prefer function declarations over expressions

# Clean, Readable, and Maintainable!

-   POLE: Principle of Least Exposure
    <br>
    Each variable, function, etc. should have the least exposure as possible. Break up the code into blocks if variable will only be used in that block.
    <br><br>
    Prefer:
    <br>

```
for(...) {
    ...
    {
        let temp; // temporary variable which is only used in this block.
    }
    ...
}
```

Over:
<br>

```
for(...) {
    ...
    let temp; // temporary variable which can be accessed throughout the entire for-loop.
    ...
}
```

-   Variable declarations
    -   Prefer `let` and `const` over `var`.
    -   Use `const` when a variable is not re-assigned.
-   New Line at the end of a file
-   Comments when neccessary.

# Documenting Code

-   <a href="https://tsdoc.org/">TSDoc</a>

# Braces

-   Spaces before opening curly brace ({) for functions and in CSS. <br>
    Prefer: `function name() {}` over `function(){}`
-   Conditional Rendering in JSX
    <br>
    <br>
    Prefer:
    <br>

```
    {
        condition ? <><> : <><>
    }
```

<br>

Over: `{condition ? <><> : <><>}`

-   Template literals, JSX classNames, etc. <br>
    Prefer: `className={ name }` & `` console.log(`${ name }`) ``
    Over: `className={name}` & `` console.log(`${name}`) ``

# Return statements in JSX

-   For JSX return statements that take up more than one line (including return statement), please wrap the JSX in parentheses. <br>
    Prefer:
    <br>
    `    return (
      <div>
          ...
      </div>
  );`
    <br>
    Over:
    <br>
    `return <div>
    ...
      </div>;
    `

# Spaces in JSX components

-   Prefer `<Component />` <br>
-   Over `<Component/>`

# Whitespace & Block Indentation

-   Break up unrelated statements with whitespace.

# Pull Requests

-   Please include screen-shots or videos of the changes you made (from the website).
